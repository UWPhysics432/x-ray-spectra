    "### Prior to working on this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Obtain a copy of the AmpTek software **DppMCA** from the link on the course website.  Note: it works only on Windows or inside a Windows environment (Students with Macs have had success this way.)  Each member of the group should try to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Download the data files with the .mca extension from the experiment page.  Start with the iron (Fe-26) data file.  Open the background (1500s) data file and then open the Fe-26 data file and compare them.  Note the large peaks above background for the iron sample.  Use the procedure described in class to set the ROI and obtain the peak position and width.  Record this data into a spreadsheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Repeat this process for all of the other known samples: find the peaks notably above background and obtain their positions and widths.  It is best to move up and down in <i>Z</i> from Fe, so that you can see how similar peaks shift as <i>Z</i> is changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Because of the large data set, the group should divide up the files, but make sure there are some that overlap, so you can check your technique by comparing results from different people.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Once you have analyzed the peaks from all of the \"knowns\" and have your procedure down, repeat for the 6 \"unknowns.\" Pay close attention to what the peak pattern looks like, and how it might compare to similar peaks among the \"knowns.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Finally, put the results into two .csv files, one for \"knowns,\" one for \"unknowns.\"  These will be read into the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks for this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make a \"Moseley plot\" of the knowns: $\\sqrt{\\rm Ch\\;\\#}$ vs. $Z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Determine the $\\text{K}_\\alpha$ series and the $\\text{L}_\\alpha$ series.  Fit lines to these to determine the screening constants $\\sigma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make initial guesses for the $Z$ values of the unknowns, and plot the peaks for these samples in the Moseley plot.  Then adjust $Z$ if needed until the unknown peaks fit the pattern of the known peaks as well as can be seen.  This completes \"Method 1\" for the unknowns.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Select the peaks corresponding to the $\\text{K}_{\\alpha1}$ series and look up the known energies of these peaks.  Then plot and fit $E_{\\text{K}_{\\alpha1}}$ versus $\\text{Ch #}$, and obtain constants to create a calibration line that converts channel number to energy in eV or keV.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Apply the calibration to the unknown peaks and look up the energies in the look-up table to match with the correct $Z$ values.  This completes \"Method 2\" for the unknowns."
